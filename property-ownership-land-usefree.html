        <h2>Types of Property Ownership</h2>
        <p>Freehold Estates: These are types of ownership where the property owner has indefinite ownership. Freehold estates include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Fee Simple Absolute:</strong> This is the most complete form of ownership, where the owner has unrestricted rights to use, transfer, and inherit the property.</li>
            <li><strong>Life Estate:</strong> Ownership lasts for the duration of a person's life, after which the property passes to another designated individual or reverts to the original owner.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Leasehold Estates: These involve renting or leasing property, where the tenant has the right to use the property for a specified period.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Tenancy for Years:</strong> A lease for a specific period.</li>
            <li><strong>Periodic Tenancy:</strong> A lease that automatically renews for successive periods unless terminated by either party.</li>
            <li><strong>Tenancy at Will:</strong> A lease that can be terminated at any time by either party.</li>
            <li><strong>Tenancy at Sufferance:</strong> When a tenant continues to occupy the property without the landlord's consent after the lease term has expired.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

        <h2>Land Use Controls</h2>
        <p>Land use controls are mechanisms that regulate how land can be used, developed, and maintained. They aim to promote sustainable development, protect the environment, and ensure the safety and well-being of the community.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Zoning Laws:</strong> Zoning is a tool used by local governments to regulate land use. It divides land into zones based on permitted uses, such as residential, commercial, industrial, and agricultural. Zoning laws determine:
                <ul>
                    <li>Building Heights and Sizes: Restrictions on how tall and large buildings can be.</li>
                    <li>Density Regulations: Limits on the number of units or buildings per area.</li>
                    <li>Setbacks: Requirements for how far structures must be set back from property lines, streets, or other structures.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Building Codes:</strong> These are standards established by local governments to ensure the safety and integrity of buildings. Building codes cover:
                <ul>
                    <li>Construction Standards: Requirements for materials, design, and construction practices.</li>
                    <li>Fire Safety: Standards for fire prevention and protection.</li>
                    <li>Accessibility: Requirements for accessibility for people with disabilities.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Easements:</strong> An easement is a legal right to use another's land for a specific purpose. Easements can be granted for various reasons, such as utility lines, access roads, or drainage systems.</li>
            <li><strong>Environmental Regulations:</strong> These are laws aimed at protecting the environment from harmful land use practices. They include regulations on:
                <ul>
                    <li>Wetlands Protection: Restrictions on development in wetlands to preserve ecosystems.</li>
                    <li>Endangered Species: Laws to protect habitats of endangered species.</li>
                    <li>Pollution Control: Standards for managing waste, emissions, and pollutants.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
